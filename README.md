## About This Project

<p>This challenge was to build out an 8-page planet fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

For a JS-heavy approach, frontendmentor provided a local data.json file for the planets. This means I'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.

Your users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
3. View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs</p>
<br>

## Built with

<p>HTML, CSS, Javascript</p>

## What I learned
- This is the largest project I've built to date and I'm incredibly proud of it. Frontendmentor provided individual html files to build out for each planet as well as a JSON file that contained all the information needed. I chose to build the site primarily using Javascript where you initially load into one page and the content on the site changes dynamically. 
- The background image was supposed to be a simple static image of stars, but I thought it would be better to have it animate as though we were moving slowly through space. This was something I hadn't done previously so playing around with CSS keyframes was fun.
- I wanted to focus a lot on the presentation/feel of the site. While frontendmentor provides all the images, I wanted to add small details that I felt grealy improved the site. For example, every time you click on a button to change the content on the page, there is a quick fade in and out transition.
