## About This Project

<p>This challenge was to build out an 8-page planet fact site and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

For a JS-heavy approach, frontendmentor provided a local data.json file for the planets. This means I'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate .html files.

Your users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
3. View each planet page and toggle between the "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology" tabs</p>

## Built with

<p>HTML, CSS</p>

## What I learned
- clamp() was a major learning experience for me. Using the min, preferred, and max values I was able to have the orange "plan card" and phone responsive and move around the page. Originally I positioned the objects absolutely and used top, right, left, & bottom and used clamp to get them to move. For the most part it worked but using clamp with margins was a lot easier especially when media queries were involved. 
- I also learned more about the use of svg. Previously I just used them as regular images and placed them where they needed to be on the page. This time however, the social media icons at the bottom of the page needed to change colors on hover and I realized I had to paste the whole svg code and change their fill using css.
